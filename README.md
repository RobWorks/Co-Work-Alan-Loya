# Co-Work-Alan-Loya
Modeling, simulation and controller design of a serial manipulator of seven degrees of freedom. Developed in MATLAB and Simulink. 

A state-space model was made based on the specifications of the Baxter industrial robot, considering its direct and differential kinematics using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention to represent each joint of the robot. A model on SolidWorks of the robot was used with Simulink to visualize our algorithm implementation.

## Requirements
SimScape, an extension to MATLAB that allows us to integrate our model with their SolidWorks parts. Instructions about how to install this extension can be found [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/smlink/ug/installing-and-linking-simmechanics-link-software.html).
